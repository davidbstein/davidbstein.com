title:  My Github account is neither a CV nor a portfolio

<p>
  For a long time I didn't have a link to my github profile. I did this because this site gets visited by recruiters, and I would prefer not to have them use the quality of my hacky little side projects as a <a href="https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/">reflection of my talent as an engineer</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It's kind of unfortunate that our community has gotten to a place where I'm hesitant to work on something new because of how it might affect my ability to get a job; removing links to my github account helped alleviate that a little.

  At some point I will probably have to compile a portfolio and put it on this webpage. Until then, I don't have a portfolio and I do not consider <code>github.com/davidbstein</code> to be an accurate or appropriate substitute.
