title: My Github account is neither a CV nor a portfolio
---

 For a long time I didn't have a link to my github profile. I did this because this site gets visited by recruiters, and I would prefer not to have them use the quality of my hacky little side projects as a [reflection of my talent as an engineer](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/). 

 It's kind of unfortunate that our community has gotten to a place where I'm hesitant to work on something new because of how it might affect my ability to get a job; removing links to my github account helped alleviate that a little. 

 At some point I will probably have to compile a portfolio and put it on this webpage. Until then, I don't have a portfolio and I do not `consider github.com/davidbstein` to be an accurate or appropriate substitute.
