I’m an academic studying the relationship between legal institutions and technical infrastructre. I am currently winding down my role as an assistant professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University. This fall, I start as an assistant professor of law at Vanderbilt.

I worked in tech for about a decade. Among other roles: I was a tech lead at [Sidewalk Labs](https://www.sidewalklabs.com){target="_blank"}, where I worked on data security, privacy, and “smart” street grids; director of product engineering at [Braze](https://www.braze.com/product/){target="_blank"}; and an early member of the engineering team at [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com){target="_blank"}, where I focused mostly on making large-scale data analytics accessible to non-engineers, including setting up the teams and infrastructure for managing security incident response, prototyping, internal tools, and sales and support automation.

My academic training is a patchwork of legal and engineering work. At NYU Law School, I was a research scholar at the Guarini Institute for Global Law and Tech, a fellow at the [Information Law Instiute](https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili/people){target="_blank"}, and co-taught a seminar on [global tech law](https://its.law.nyu.edu/courses/description.cfm?id=32595){target="_blank"} as an adjunct professor. At MIT, I did graduate research at the [Computer Science and AI Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory){target="_blank"}, first on distributed robtics and later on homomorphically encrypted biometric recognition. I also worked on design priciples for space-based synthetic aperature radar at the [Systems Engineering Advancement Research Initiative](https://seari.mit.edu/){target="_blank"}.

I currently live in NYC and work at NYU Law School. At NYU, I'm a research scholar at the [Guarini Institute for Global Law and Tech](https://www.guariniglobal.org/current-team), a fellow at the [Information Law Institute](https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili/people), and I co-teach a seminar on [global tech law](https://its.law.nyu.edu/courses/description.cfm?id=32595) as an adjunct. Outside of the law school, I do some contract work helping with large-scale data collection and analytics, and a little bit of angel investing.

from 2009-2011 i did research in distributed robotics at <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" title="" target="_blank">MIT CSAIL</a>, where I designed and built heterogeneous robot swarms to prove feasibility of automated distributed construction of large structures. In 2020, I returned briefly to write my Master's thesis, demonstrating a novel approach to homomorphically encrypted biometric recognition.
