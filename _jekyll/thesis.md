In 2011, after completing my coursework and two drafts of my thesis, I dropped out to join [Dropbox](dropbox.com) before their [first major round of fundraising](https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/12/dropbox-raising-massive-round-at-a-5b-plus-valuation/){:target="_blank"}.

[Here](/static/thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"} is a copy of the last draft of my master's thesis. I made some minor edits in 2013, but have otherwise resisted the urge to fix the many problems with the document.
