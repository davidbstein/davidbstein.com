      <h1>I have removed the link to my github from this page.</h1>
      <div>
        I have done so because this site gets visited by recruiters, and I would prefer not to have them use the quality of my hacky little side projects as a [reflection of my talent as an engineer](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/).
      </div>
      <div>
        It's kind of unfortunate that our community has gotten to a place where I'm hesitant to work on something new because of how it might affect my ability to get a job; removing links to my github account helps alleviate that a little.
      </div>
      <div>
        At some point I will probably have to compile a portfolio and put it on this webpage. Until then, I don't have a portfolio and I do not consider my github to be an accurate or appropriate substitute.
